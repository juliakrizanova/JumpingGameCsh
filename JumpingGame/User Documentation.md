### Jumping

To overcome obstacles and reach higher platforms, you must master the art of jumping. Press the `Space` key to make the player character jump. Timing is crucial, so make sure to time your jumps accurately to avoid falling into pits or touching enemies.

### Defeating Enemies

You can defeat enemies by jumping on top of them. When you successfully jump on an enemy, it will be defeated, and you'll earn points. However, if you touch an enemy without jumping on them, you'll lose a life, and the level will restart. So, be sure to time your jumps carefully. 
In the game, there are 2 types of enemies. One of them is white and one green.:
- The white one can kill you when colliding with it, in order to defeat this enemy, it is necessary to jump on top of it.
- The green enemy is tougher to defeat, as even when you jump on top of it, it can be pushed if you hit it from the side. This causes it to slide at a rapid speed, and it can even push you into a pit, resulting in a game over. Be cautious when dealing with this enemy to avoid potential pitfalls.
